### Project Plan
Problem:
	In a world with so much knowledge at our fingertips, it’s hard to know where to start when you’re a burgeoning cook.  With an overwhelming variety of kitchen equipment and recipes available on the internet, new cooks are often unsure of which tools are essential for their level of expertise and for the specific recipes they wish to create.
	This is compounded by the fact that many existing online platforms lack user-friendly and comprehensive resources that address both kitchen equipment and recipes cohesively. Users are often left to navigate multiple platforms trying to make sense of individual equipment and recipe reviews.  As a result, potential cooks may find themselves investing in unnecessary equipment and supplies, leading to frustration, wasted money, and ultimately a negative association with their new cooking journey.

Objectives:
    -Provides a user-friendly web application that cohesively brings together information about kitchen equipment and  recipes on one platform
    -Empowers inexperienced cooks to confidently select the necessary kitchen tools they need and explore exciting recipes suitable for their skill level
    -Foster a community of enthusiastic new cooks where they can share and review resources
